This is a distributed file sharing system.
Up to now we have implemented that create a node object and register with bootstrap server.

1. Compile the and run the server file in the directory
    ~/DistributedContentSearching/resources/Bootstrap Server/Java/BootstrapServer.java
    In the ~/DistributedContentSearching/resources/Bootstrap Server/Java directory open the terminal
    Run the following codes
        Compilation : javac BootstrapServer.java
        Run         : java BootstrapServer
2. Open the pom.xml file from Intellij IDEA.
3. Run the ~/DistributedContentSearching/src/main/java/com/CS4262/App.java file
    It will create and register 10 node objects with the server you ran in step 1
    results will be shown in Intellij IDEA terminal.
